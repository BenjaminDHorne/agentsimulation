<h1>Overview of the taNdem Simulation Package<a class="headerlink" href="#overview-of-the-tandem-simulation-package" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This package implements an agent scenario in which agents share
information with each other in a networked setting. The package
incorporates many adjustable parameters that are easily extensible. We
give an overview of these characteristics in this document.</p>
<p>The code is available on:</p>
<blockquote>

<div class="section" id="agent-connectivity">
<h2>Agent Connectivity<a class="headerlink" href="#agent-connectivity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Agents are connected to each other through a network that determines
their connectivity. Each edge is currently of the same strength and/or
bandwidth. The connectivity can be generated using different
algorithms. Currently, we have two basic methods:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Random graphs</strong> (Erdos–Renyi) of a given connection probability</li>
<li><strong>Spatial random graphs</strong> in which agents are distributed in a one by
one grid. The connection prbability is then given by a radius. All
nodes with distance within a given radius are connected.</li>
<li><strong>Hierarchy</strong> implements a single hierarchy of three levels, leader
(agent 0), second level managers and employees.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <tt class="xref py py-mod docutils literal"><span class="pre">GraphGen</span></tt> module implements this function:</p>

<h2>Agent Behavior Characteristics<a class="headerlink" href="#agent-behavior-characteristics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Agents have characteristics that determine their behaviors. These
characteristics are summarized below.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Competence</strong> describes the ability to discern signal from noise
in information</li>
<li><strong>Willingness</strong> describes the percentage of time the agent will
perform an action. Willingness can model the reliability of the
agent or the attention they can give to a specific problem.</li>
<li><strong>Capacity</strong> describes the number of actions the agent is able to
take at each step of the simulation, if it is willing. Capacity is
set to 1 by default.</li>
<li><strong>Spamminess</strong> describes the percentage of the time the agent will
spam a neighbor by sending the same information. By default, agents
do not spam.</li>
<li><strong>Selfishness</strong> describes the percentage of the neighbors the agent
will share information with, instead of keeping it to
self. Selfishness describes whether agent will act in self-interest
or in the interest of the network. Agents are not selfish by default.</li>
<li><strong>Trust</strong> characteristics describe whether the agent uses trust to
to filter who to send messages to (outbox filtering) and order messages
from other agents (inbox sorting). The trust can be turned on (default)
or off.</li>
<li><strong>Spam sensitivity</strong> describes how much the agent considers spamming
behavior of others as a measure of their incompetence axis of trust.
Depending on the scenario, this can be adjusted. When set to zero,
spamming of others does not effect the trust ratings.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a class="reference internal" href="classes.html#module-Agent" title="Agent"><tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">Agent</span></tt></a> module sets these parameters.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/rpitrust/agentsimulation/blob/master/Agent.py">https://github.com/rpitrust/agentsimulation/blob/master/Agent.py</a></div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="trust">
<h2>Trust<a class="headerlink" href="#trust" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Agents can base their behavior based on trust. In this case, they need
to assess their trust for others based on their prior trust and
evidence. An agent&#8217;s trust belief for another agent consist of two
components:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Competence</strong> is the belief that the other agent has the ability
to distinguish signal from noise. The competence belief is given
with a prior value, i.e. initial belief, and evidence obtained
within the simulation. The initial belief is given by a trust value
and associated uncertainty. If uncertainty is low, new evidence
will have little effect in the given belief. The evaluation of
evidence is tied to the agent&#8217;s competence: a person who can tell
signal from noise can also better judge other agents&#8217; competence.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Willingness</strong> is the belief that the other agent will dedicate
their energy to sending the agent information, instead of helping
others or serving self-interest. Willingness models rational
reciprocal information sharing behavior. It is seeded with a prior
belief and associated uncertainty. If uncertainty is very low,
simulation based evidence has no effect on willingness
beliefs. Unlike competence, willingness beliefs are relative to
others. When there is no information to share, then agents share
nothing. This does not impact the beliefs about their willingness
negatively.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Both beliefs are used to determine whether an agent can be
trusted. Currently, the competence and willingness levels are used
to determine a qualitative rating of trust, as given by the table
below:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="32%" />
<col width="29%" />
<col width="20%" />
<col width="20%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>Comp &gt; 0.8</td>
<td>T = 3</td>
<td>T = 4</td>
<td>T = 5</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>Comp &lt;=   0.8</td>
<td>T = 3</td>
<td>T = 4</td>
<td>T = 4</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>Comp &lt;=   0.6</td>
<td>T = 1</td>
<td>T = 2</td>
<td>T = 2</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>0</td>
<td>Will &lt;= 0.6</td>
<td>Will
&lt;= 0.8</td>
<td>Will
&gt; 0.8</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Note that the thresholds can be changed in the <tt class="xref py py-mod docutils literal"><span class="pre">Trust</span></tt>  module:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/rpitrust/agentsimulation/blob/master/Trust.py">https://github.com/rpitrust/agentsimulation/blob/master/Trust.py</a></p>
<p>In this case, trust values go from 5 (highest) to 1 (lowest). Trust
value of 1 is considered not trust. We current do not model
distrust in the simulation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The trust module allows new evidence to be entered periodically and
old evidence to be forgotten at a specified rate.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="simulation-method">
<h2>Simulation Method<a class="headerlink" href="#simulation-method" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Currently, the simulation environment models a scenario in which
agents send information to each other. Originally, the network is
seeded with some initial set of information. Each agent has access to
some facts by having it in its inbox. Some of the information is
valuable and some of it is noise. The signal to noise ratio can be
changed.</p>
<p>The agents in the model are limited. They can only do one action at a
time (unless they explicitly have higher capacity). The main action
that is implemented in the simulation is sharing of information in
one&#8217;s inbox. At each point in time, if the agent is willing for that
period, it can do one of two actions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Send one piece of information that is in its outbox to a neighbor:
from most trusted to the least trusted if trust is used, randomly
otherwise.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Pop one piece of information that is in its inbox, determine if it
is valuable, and then queue it to be sent to all neighbors by
placing it in its outbox.</p>
<p>When determining whether information is valuable or not, the
competence of the agent determines how frequently the agent will
get it correctly.</p>
<p>Then, the agent will decide who to send it to based on spamminess
and selfishness parameters.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The simulation starts by processing all information that is in agents&#8217;
inbox and placing them in their outbox based on their
personalities. The agents are also seeded with initial trust if trust
is used. The simulation then proceeds for a predetermined number of
steps.</p>
<p>Periodically a set of performance statistics area collected from the
networked. These statistics are summarized at the end of the
simulation. Simulations can be repeated for a number of prespecified
times and the average performance is reported at the end.</p>
<p>Performance statistics considered include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Situation awareness (SA)</strong> is the average percentage of all valuable
facts known to all the agents in the network.</li>
<li><strong>Situation awareness single (SA-0)</strong> is the average percentage of
all  valuable facts known to a specific agent in the network. This
helps us model the case where only a single agent getting the
relevant information is important. Often agent 0 is monitored for
this purpose. Agent 0 is also the lead of the group in the
hierarchy graph.</li>
<li><strong>Communications</strong> is the total number of messages sent in the
network. Communications are monitored as a function of the number
of messages needed to reach a certain level of SA (or SA-0).</li>
<li><strong>Steps</strong> is the total number of simulation steps needed to reach a
certain level of SA (or SA-0).</li>
</ul>
<p>The simulation is implemented in the <tt class="xref py py-mod docutils literal"><span class="pre">simulation</span></tt> module:</p>
